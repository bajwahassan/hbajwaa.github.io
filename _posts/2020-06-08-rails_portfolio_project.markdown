This is a rails based application called "MUST". The application keeps track of the movies a user wants to watch or have watched and would like to keep the name saved somewhere. 

This project is for Flatirion School Bootcamp, which has certain requirements for the project. Click [here](https://learn.co/tracks/online-software-engineering-structured/rails/rails-project-mode/rails-portfolio-project) to see the requirements.

Users first need to sign-up for an account, to start creating movies they'd not wanna miss. To Sign up users have two options: by generic email and password, or log in through facebook. I used omniauth for third party authentication.

After User is logged in, they will be able to create multiple lists:

Now a list has been created, user can hop in that list and create movies for that list:

User can also edit or delete a movie:

A sort button has also been created, if a user would like to see the movies by recent year:

I used a scope method for sorting movies:

For user interface a little bootstrap was used, will be updating the user interface as I learn more frontend designing. Also more features will be added soon, one of them will be sort and search by genre.
