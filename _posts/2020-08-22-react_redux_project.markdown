Out of all the projects I'd say I learned most in this project. At start I struggled a little bit trying to understand redux, and

still have to look things up once in a while. Although it was a little complicated at the start, but afterwards things get real 

simple. There's a small amount of boiler plate setup, but afterwards it gets real simple.

I loved how you separate different jobs and organize the code. It really helps adding new features or debugging the code.

I created a Pet Land app, where users will be able to see available pets of all kinds. The app will include many different 

kind of animals and birds. 

A user will be able to buy pets, and also see some products available for sale. The products section will hold grooming 

and pet food items. Users can also contact the store through the contact page, to get any information they need.
