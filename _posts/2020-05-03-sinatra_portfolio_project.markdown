Working on my Sinatra Portfolio project was a learning experience with lots of ups and downs, but ultimately, I have learned a lot in such little time. 
I created an Employee Management database, based on sinatra and activerecord.  
Users (someone who will be managing the database) first need to signup for their company, then they are able to create a database on their employees.

Sign Up Page- Here users will be able to Sign Up or Log In with a 'unique' email.

User's Home Page- After logging in, this will be user's home page, where they will be able to add, edit or delete.

The only thing I wish I knew more was css styling, which can make a website appearence beautiful. I intend to learn more 
on styling. The hard part for me was figuring out html syntax and design, one specific part was creating buttons and 
arranging their positions. 
I enjoyed working on this project, specially playing around with activerecord and tux gem, which helped a lot.
