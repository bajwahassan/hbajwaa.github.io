## What is Redux?
Redux is a state management tool for JavaScript applications. Itâ€™s generally used with React, but can be used with any UI layer or framework, including Angular, Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS. The core idea behind Redux is to store the entire state of an application in one central location.


## Why use Redux?
Managing the state when building complex things was such a pain in the neck until Redux arrived. Each component of an application can have direct access to the state of the application without having to send props down to child components from parent components. This can make the code simpler and, it can also improve rendering performance.
React is awesome, and developing a full application is entirely possible using nothing but react. However, as an application becomes more complex, use of plain old react is often not as straightforward.
