I have had an innate passion for logical problem solving since childhood, which explains my forthright interests in Software Engineering. It has always been fascinating to me how a machine could solve a long problem in seconds.  

My passion lies in solving problems creatively, more the technical more I enjoy. I started my higher education as a math major. I was not so sure about much secure career outcomes as a math major, So I switched to Finance. I recently graduated with a BBA in Finance.

Although finance was somewhat technical but lacked the technology part. In my senior year, I realized I won't be happy working in finance for the rest of my life. I had taken some CS classes before and realized that is something I could do, which will satisfy me. 

Changing major now meant extra years as there are so many degree requirements in a computer science degree. I was then told by a friend about boot camps, So I started researching about it and was impressed in every way. After doing my research I finalized that Flatiron School would be a great fit for me, and here I am.
