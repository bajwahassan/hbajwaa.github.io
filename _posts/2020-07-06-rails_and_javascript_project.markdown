This is a simple To-Do list application. This app uses Rails as backend, and JavaScript and CSS for frontend. Application is fairly simple to use.

This project was undoubtedly my favorite in terms of  developing a JS and Rails Project. I really enjoyed learning how 
JavaScript manages frontend. 

To be honest my rails project was more complicated than this, since this is just a single page applications. I learned a lot through this project some of the concepts are DOM Manipulation , EventDelegations, variable scope, Hoisting, JSON etc. There is so much to learn about it, but now it makes sense how a modern website works.

I kept, this project fairly simple, and I think anyone who understands JS syntax will be able to understand this frontend portion of my project.

You can check my project @ [To-Do-List](https://github.com/hbajwaa/todo_api)

After following the project usage guide, app is fairly straightforward to use.
